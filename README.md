## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Features

Modify `utils/preprocessing.py` to add custom network features:

```python
def create_custom_features(df):
    # Add your custom feature engineering here
    df['custom_feature'] = df['feature1'] / (df['feature2'] + 1)
    return df
```

### Adjusting Model Parameters

Edit `train_model.py` to modify K-means configurations:

```python
kmeans_configs = [
    {'n_clusters': 15, 'init': 'k-means++', 'max_iter': 1000},
    # Add more configurations
]
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & Performance Testing

### Performance Verification

Run the built-in performance test to verify your installation:

```bash
python test_performance.py
```

Expected output:

```
✓ FAST: Processing time is excellent
✓ EXCELLENT: Model accuracy is very good
Processing Speed: 47,000+ samples/second
Accuracy: 86%+
```

### Threshold Optimization

If accuracy is lower than expected, optimize the threshold:

```bash
python optimize_threshold.py
```

This will test different thresholds and save the optimal one automatically.

### Common Issues

1. **"Model files not found"**

   - Solution: Run `python train_model.py` to train the models first

2. **Low accuracy (<80%)**

   - Solution: Run `python optimize_threshold.py` to find optimal threshold
   - Alternative: Retrain with `python train_model.py`

3. **Slow processing (>2 seconds)**

   - Check: Run `python test_performance.py` to benchmark
   - Solution: Ensure you're using the optimized models from recent training

4. **Memory errors during training**

   - Solution: Reduce dataset size or increase available RAM

5. **Web interface not loading**
   - Check: Flask installation with `pip install flask`
   - Check: Port 5000 availability
   - Try: Different port with `app.run(port=5001)`

### Performance Troubleshooting

| Issue    | Expected         | Actual | Solution                    |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| Speed    | >30K samples/sec | <10K   | Re-run `train_model.py`     |
| Accuracy | >85%             | <80%   | Run `optimize_threshold.py` |
| F1-Score | >85%             | <70%   | Check dataset quality       |
| Memory   | <2GB             | >4GB   | Use smaller batch sizes     |
